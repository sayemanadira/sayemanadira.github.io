        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This project was designed to familiarize computer science students with machine learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and to introduce the general process of training, testing, and evaluating models. The tutorial involves creating music, which makes the learning experience more intuitive, as students can hear the differences in the output data. This helps illustrate how changing hyperparameters can significantly affect the model’s results.</p>

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>The tutorial pipeline consists of four main stages: <b>data collection, data processing, model training, and output generation.</b>

In the data collection stage, users have two options: scraping songs from YouTube or using a dataset from Kaggle. The YouTube scraping option enables users to create a "semi-personalized" dataset by curating a playlist of songs they want the model to learn from. This allows them to influence characteristics such as the notes available, the step sizes, and the overall tempo of the music. The Kaggle option provides a ready-made dataset, offering less personalization but allowing for quicker setup.

During the data processing stage, collected songs that typically in waveform format (.wav) are converted into MIDI (.mid) files. MIDI files provide a piano-roll-like visualization of the music, which makes it easier to understand the structure of the song. Unlike waveform files that represent amplitude over time, MIDI files explicitly encode note pitch, duration, and timing, making them more intuitive for analysis and machine learning applications.

In the training phase, an LSTM model is used to predict the next note in a sequence by evaluating the most likely note to follow a given input. Over time, the model learns to generate sequences of notes that resemble the structure and style of the input music.

Finally, in the output stage, users can listen to the music generated by the model. This auditory feedback makes it easy to evaluate the impact of different hyperparameters and training setups, providing an engaging and intuitive way to explore machine learning concepts.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The model was able to generate coherent musical output; however, the primary goal of the project was to help users become familiar with machine learning concepts. In fact, instances of incoherence in the generated music serve as useful teaching moments, helping to illustrate how different model functions and parameters affect the outcome.

One notable limitation is that the music generation works best with monophonic music. The model struggles to interpret and reproduce pieces with multiple instruments or overlapping melodies. This is an area we are interested in exploring further in the future.

As a result of these limitations, our initial goal of delivering a polished, high-quality product shifted. Instead, we embraced the constraints and reframed the tutorial as a learning experience, focusing on helping users understand the inner workings and nuances of machine learning models rather than simply delivering perfect output.</p>
